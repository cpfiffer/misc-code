```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
```

You can make strings with ' or ", there's no difference. Usually it's best to use quotes because it's less likely to show up in a string.

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x,"a.")
```

The above code is pretty awesome. It matches anything that has an "a" followed by any other character except for a newline. We can use a `^` symbol to refer to the start of a string and a `$` to refer to the end of the string. Some useful others:

* `\d` matches any digit
* `\s` matches any whitespace
* `[abc]` matchs a, b, or c
* `[^abc]` matches anything except a, b, or c
