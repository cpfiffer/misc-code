```{r echo = FALSE, error=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

#Now we load the relevant datasets
data(flights)
data("airlines")
data("airports")
data("planes")
data("weather")
```

```{r}
weather
airports
```
The link between weather and airports is the `faa` column in airports, which lists it as Newark's airport, and the `origin` column in weather. 

Let's make sure that each table's keys are truly unique.

```{r}
planes %>%
  count(tailnum) %>%
  filter(n > 1)

weather %>%
  count(year, month,day, hour, origin) %>%
  filter(n > 1)

#Hooray, each one is unique and special, like a lovely snowflake. Let's add a key to flights so we can identify each flight.

flights2 <- flights %>%
  mutate(key = row_number()) %>%
  select(-origin, -dest) %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier")

flights2
```
